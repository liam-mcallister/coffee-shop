## 1. Description

A website that allows users to check the cafes menu and book a table.

With this project, I wanted to get experience incorporating some jQuery plugins. To start, I wanted to add animations to various components as the user scrolls down the page. After searching around on Google, I settled on AOS.js as it is very easy to use and the animations are smooth.

As every great cafe/restaurant website has a gallery, finding a lightbox plugin was next on my list. I decided to go with Strip.js because I quite like the way it slides out from the side and the enlarged images don’t take up the entire screen either.

There are two contact forms on this website, the quick book form (slides up from the bottom of every page) and the form on the contact page. For the quick book form, I went with the jQuery validation plugin from the Bel-Cab Tours website but for the contact page form I wanted to try a different plugin. For this I used Parsley.js which I ended up preferring in the end as it is a much simpler solution as you only need to add some custom attributes for it to work.
